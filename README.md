This repository was made to show my progress in studying Web programming.

I studied web programming many years ago. Unfortunately, I had to start working in a non-IT environment and lost some of my skills. Here, I am going to practice to regain my skills in Frontend Development. In the future, I plan to become a Fullstack Developer. Currently, I am just learning and acquiring new skills.
